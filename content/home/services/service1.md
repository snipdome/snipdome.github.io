One of my strongest skills is problem inspection and decomposition, which is an essential procedure for tackling down real-world challenges. My approach involves thoroughly analyzing problems to identify underlying factors, in order to break them down into manageable and, if possible, controllable components. This methodology has laid the foundation for my understanding of clean and maintainable programming, as well as deep learning.
