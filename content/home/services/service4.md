With a PhD specializing in X-ray physics, I possess extensive expertise in X-ray generation and interaction, focusing on CT image reconstruction, X-ray scatter compensation, Monte Carlo simulations and CT-image registration. I developed GPU-distributed version of poly-chromatic and discrete iterative reconstructions. The methodologies and insights I have gained are currently applied in both industrial and medical settings.
