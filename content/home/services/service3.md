I specialize in applying deep learning to challenging computer vision tasks, including semantic segmentation and 3D image analysis in noisy environments. With experience in both supervised and unsupervised learning, Iâ€™ve developed advanced models for medical imaging and industrial applications like porosity detection in 3D printed parts, as well as reinforcement learning in medical applications.
