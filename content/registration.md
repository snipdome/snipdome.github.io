Imagine a factory where rapid and accurate quality control is essential for maintaining production efficiency and product reliability. Traditional methods like X-ray computed tomography offer precise internal inspections but are often too expensive and time-consuming for routine quality checks.

To address this challenge, I developed a faster, cost-effective alternative that enables analysis directly in projection space by registering the object and its CAD model using only a few X-ray radiographs. This approach facilitates the comparison between acquired and simulated projections, simplifying defect detection and providing information about X-ray path lengthsâ€”useful for post-processing methods like beam-hardening compensation. The method utilises a mesh projector implemented as differential program ([CAD-ASTRA](https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.498194)), a tool that simulates X-ray projections from known object surfaces.
#### How It Works

1. Initial Setup: Start with an approximate position and orientation of the objects composing the scanned scene.
2. X-Ray Projection Simulation: Use CAD-ASTRA to simulate the projections.
3. Mesh Registration: Employ a PyTorch framework to iteratively adjust the objects pose to match the X-ray projections.
