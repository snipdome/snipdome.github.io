Hey there! I am a curious engineer who enjoys to understand and simplify complex tasks, by building even more complex procedures that serve as solutions. With over 8 years under my belt in crafting software solutions, I have wandered through the realms of X-ray physics, computer vision, and artificial intelligence.

My journey took me from the historic halls of the Biomedical Engineering department of "La Sapienza" University of Rome, where I tried to backtrack therapeutic particles just for fun (and a master's degree), to the industrial world - until I landed in Antwerp where I am currently living. Along the way, I have convinced computers to enhance 2D/3D images, to spot tiny defects playing hide-and-seek in noisy environments, and even tried to teach them to do my chores (they're still rebelling..).

Fluent in C++, CUDA, and Pythonic languages (tried with Dutch, but its syntax is still rather obscure), I have developed and maintained scalable, distributed apps that make GPUs sweat. When I'm not busy dodging X-rays or mentoring future tech gurus, you might find me smashing shuttlecocks on a badminton court or whipping up my next baking adventure.
